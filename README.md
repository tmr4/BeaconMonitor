# BeaconMonitor

A T41 beacon monitor app for your PC.  This is a work in progress

## Build

Create a new .NET Maui app project in Visual Studio 2022 and replace the autogenerated C# and XAML files with the ones in this repository.  If you run it in Windows it will create a BeaconMonitor app.  This is supposed to work on other platforms as well (a feature of .Net Maui) but I haven't tested that.

## Use

Requires my [T41_SDR](https://github.com/tmr4/T41_SDR) software which must be compiled with a `Dual` or `Triple` USB Type. Select the appropriate COM port (not the one you normally use to program the T41).  The beacon monitor can be started or paused with the Start/Pause button.
